13	Introducing Manus 1.5
14	Thursday, October 16
15	Product
16	We're introducing Manus 1.5, our most capable agent system to date. Manus 1.5 delivers significant improvements in speed, reliability, and quality across all task types — from research and data analysis to web development and presentation creation.
17	This release features two new agents: Manus-1.5 offers the full power of our latest architecture, while Manus-1.5-Lite provides a streamlined experience optimized for cost efficiency.
18	What's Improved
19	Manus 1.5 is built on a re-architected engine that makes everything faster and more reliable. On average, tasks now complete nearly four times faster — dropping from 15 minutes in April to just under 4 minutes today. For more complex tasks, Manus can now allocate additional reasoning time and computational power to deliver deeper, higher-quality results.
20	﻿
21	This performance boost is matched by significant improvements in intelligence. Tasks that once failed due to complexity now succeed, and deliverables are consistently of higher quality. In our internal benchmarks, the Manus 1.5 architecture achieved a 15% improvement in task quality compared to earlier versions, and we've seen a 6% increase in user satisfaction.
22	In addition to speed and intelligence, Manus 1.5 can now handle larger and more complex problems thanks to an expanded context window for single tasks. This allows the agent to maintain coherence across longer conversations and more intricate workflows, ensuring no important detail is lost.
23	Building Complete Web Applications
24	One of the major enhancements in this release is full-stack web application development. You can now build and deploy production-ready web apps entirely through conversation with Manus — no need to leave the platform to set up hosting, configure backends, or debug deployment issues. This goes far beyond generating static pages: Manus can create sophisticated applications with persistent backends, databases, user authentication, and embedded AI capabilities.
25	What sets this apart is that web development in Manus isn't an isolated feature. As a general AI agent, Manus leverages its full range of capabilities to support web development — from conducting deep research and generating images to autonomously installing tools or packages that enhance the development process. Unlike typical "AI website builders", Manus can execute an entire value chain within a single context: researching and producing in-depth content, building the website, analyzing user interaction data, and generating insights or presentation slides based on those findings.
26	The table below provides an overview of the core capabilities available for web application development in Manus 1.5:

81	Collaboration and Library
82	Manus 1.5 also introduces Collaboration, allowing you to invite team members into a shared session to work together with Manus. The new Library provides a centralized location for all your generated files and artifacts, making it easier to organize and access your work.
